Power factor is a key parameter that measures the effectiveness of electrical power utilization in a system. A low power factor results in inefficient use of electricity, leading to increased energy costs and decreased overall system performance. The Automatic Power Factor Improver addresses this issue by automatically adjusting and maintaining the power factor within an optimal range. The Automatic Power Factor Improver operates by monitoring the power factor of the electrical system in real-time. When it detects a deviation from the desired power factor, it activates reactive power compensation elements, such as capacitors or reactors, to bring the power factor back to the target level. This dynamic adjustment ensures that the electrical system operates with optimal efficiency under varying load conditions. Power factor improvement (PFI) in electrical systems can be achieved through various methods. Capacitor banks, installed in parallel, are commonly employed to compensate for reactive power and enhance power factor. In this project we use this method to improve power factor.
